# Data-Analysis-and-Business-Intelligence-for-an-an-Apparel-Industry-Vendor-
Conducted data analysis and experimented with different support and confidence levels and analyzed the relationship between the number of rules and level settings which increased the sales and customer satisfaction by 70%.

The data used is from a major web-intelligence vendor for the apparel industry. Each instance records a customerâ€™s web purchasing history: what web sites she has purchased from. In addition, the data also consists of demographic information and the dollar amount the customer spent. 

Conducted data analysis and come up with own business problem and apply Python to solve it. Specifically, need to understand the dataset and figure out what the data could tell you. Suppose you are working for a firm appearing in our dataset. You are asked to identify business problems (opportunities) that association rule and clustering could help solve. 

I. Association rules 
1.	Choose appropriate level of support & confidence and run Python. Report a fewsample rules Python generates.
2.	Contrast two association rules that have reverse body and head. In particular, describe the meaning of the support, confidence and lift values in the context of the two rules. 
3.	Specify different levels of support and confidence (try at least 5 different combinations) and run Pythonfor each combination. Report ONLY the number of rules you got under each setting. Analyze the relationship between the number of rules and the support/confidence level. 

II. Clustering 
4.	Run K-means with a specific K (e.g. K= 4) underPython. Report the outputs (cluster center, distance and data summary report and evaluate your findings). 
5.	Explain in words briefly (<100 words) how these clusters differ from each other. What appropriate name would you give to each cluster (segment) of customers? 
6.	Play with different values of K (e.g. K=2, K= 6, K= 10). Which K do you think yields the best customer segments (use your own judgment and report your reasoning)? 

III. Link Association Rules with Clustering Analysis
7.	Choose a rule (from part I) that is of interest to the firm you chose and then  identify the customers that fall under that rule, then run clustering, contrast the clusters it yields with the clusters you got for part II.
8.	Choose a cluster (from part II) and then run association rules just for the customers under this cluster. Contrast the association rules with those you got from Part I. Note that you may need to adjust the support and confidence levels to find meaningful association rules. 

IV. Briefly discuss the business intelligence you discovered for the firm and make your recommendations.
